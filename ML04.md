Multi-variable linear regression.
------------------------------------

#Multi variables
One variable : H(x) = wx + b
Multi : H(x) = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + b

##Matrix multiplication
We can use matrix multiplication in this situation.

(x1, x2, x3) * (w1) = (x1w1 + x2w2 + x3w3)
               (w2)
               (w3)
               
So, H(x) = X * W (X, W = matrix)

#Multi X
In some datasets, there are many rows of X variable.
(Rows of X = Instances)

In this case, we can also use matrix multiplication, too.

##Multi X multiplication
(x11, x12, x13)   (w1)
(x21, x22, x23) * (w2) = H(X) = X * W
(x31, x32, x33)   (w3)

(5,3) * (3,1) = (5,1) (matrix)

#Expression
We use H(x) = XW ,instead of WX
