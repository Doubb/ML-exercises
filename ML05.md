Logistic Classification
===========================

Binary Classification
------------------------
Choose one of two cases - zero or one

1. E-mail : Spam(1) or Ham mail(0)
2. Facebook : show(1) or hide(0)
3. Credit card fraudulent detection : legitimate(0) or fraud(1)

Nowadays, binary classification is used in many complex cases.
1. Radiology
2. Finance

P/F based on binary classification
-------------------------
We can use linear regression model for this case.

1. Make a linear graph based on dataset.
2. If, the y value of graph is larger than 0.5, we can consider it
as pass(1).
3. Vice versa, the y value which is smaller than 0.5 is same as
fail(0).

However, because we should make a linear graph, a x value which
is very big or small can affect the whole shape of linear graph.

In other words, it can change the gradient of hypothesis, because
hypothesis can give values larger than 1 or smaller than 0.

Logistic function
------------------
We should compress linear regression's hypothesis model into
a function that the y value is zero to one.

So, we use sigmoid function(logistic function).

z = WX / H(x) = g(z)

H(x) = 1 / (1+e^(-W^T*X))

Cost function
------------------
This is a cost function for sigmoid function.

cost(w) = mean(c(H,y))

c(H,y) = -log(H) (y=1) or -log(1-H) (y=0)
       = -ylog(H) -(1-y)log(1-H)
       
With this cost function, we can use gradient descent algorithm, 
because the slope of this cost function is smooth.
